I have come to NWMSU, Maryville for the MS ACS Spring program  and looking forward to learn emerging technologies that have good potential in the Web Apps arena.

I'm from Hyderabad, India and have pursued my Bachelors of Engineering in the Computer Science field. I did have a experience of 14 months in the IT Industry as a Java Resource. My spent most of time knowing about gadgets and reading the tech news.

I'm interested to work as Software Developer for a product based company.
